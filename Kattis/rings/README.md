# [Rings](https://open.kattis.com/problems/rings)

2D geometry to check if each pair of circles (rings) intersect with each other (are glued together). Then calculate the largest components. The calculation can be done with a search. But in my code, I used a disjoint set and calculate by maintaining each set's size.
