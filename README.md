# OI_Practice

This is a repo of solutions for some ACM-ICPC problems. The problems are from different online judges like [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/). These solutions are just sample solutions and not necessarily the best solutions. The author is happy to learn better solutions.

## Some words from the author

I am a former OIer who started programming competition from Grade 10 with C/C++. As many other OIers, I have some 'bad' coding habits in my solutions:

- My syntax is more close to C. That's because C is my first language.
- I seldom use STL since back in high school, I chose to learn data structures by coding all of them instead of using the library. 
- I seldom use pointer in my code. Maybe that's because all my fellows seldom use pointers.
- ... more in code I believe ...

Please don't judge :) I am also trying to change some of these habits (ie. try to use STL more often)
